## Genre
This game is of the "4 X" genre: eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate. In this case, you control planetary populations which produce resources for you. Using those resources, you build fleets of ships to explore other planets, colonize, build more resources, and attack your neighbors.

## Version 1.60 history
This version is the one I modified back in 1991 to add greater strategy and realism to the game - at the time I went by the user name "The Doctor" (after Dr. Who, of course). Remember, this is an old program meant to run under a WWIV BBS and DOS. Total memory used was about 110k RAM. This is a strategy game: Users would log onto the BBS one at a time, make their moves, then log off. At midnight, all the moves would be resolved. No no, not real time; in fact games might take a month or two to complete.

### Enhancements I added
1. Planetary populations
2. Ship crew
3. Ability to move populations from planet to planet
4. Re-added scanners in the form of radars to see advancing fleets
5. More realistic positioning of fleets in real-space as they travelled. Interception of fleets before they entered range of a planet became possible
5. Warp gates!
6. Long-range warp missiles which could remotely bombard a planet!

## Future Plans
The intention is to recreate this as a modern web-based, massively multiplayer strategy game making use of Azure functionality for the backend API and logic (perhaps Azure Functions as REST calls or similar). Actual client design is to be determined, as I am not a great web designer/coder and my graphic/art skills are rudimentary at best.

Has this been done before? Sure. So what? I've wanted to recreate what I contributed to for a long time. While the concept won't be new, I'm hoping the actual game play will feel fresh enough.
