# Dominion
Source code to old Turbo Pascal BBS door game. This version (1.60) is the one I modified back in 1991 to add greater strategy and realism to the game - at the time I went by the user name "The Doctor" (after Dr. Who, of course). Remember, this is an old program meant to run under a WWIV BBS and DOS. Total memory used was about 110k RAM.
